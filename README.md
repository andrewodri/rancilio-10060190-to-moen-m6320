# Rancilio 10060190 to Moen M6320 adapter

This adapter is designed to allow a [Moen M6320 12-point handle](https://www.moen.ca/products/MLine/MLine_Handle/M6320) to be fitted in place of the OEM steam handle (part number 10060186 or 10060190) for the [Rancilio Silvia M espresso machine](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/1-Rancilio-Homeline--Silvia). This adapter has been designed to meet the following criteria:

* **Heatproof.** Because this component is intended to be attached directly to a steam boiler, it needs to be heatproof. Initial prototypes were printed in high-temperature FDA approved food-grade plastic, however, these were inadequate and softened at higher temperatures. Stainless steel is really the only material available at this point in time.
* **Low complexity.** 3D printed stainless steel suffers from poor dimensional accuracy (Â±5% deviation) and has a tendency to warp. A symmetrical design with thick walls and simple cavities is required.
* **High tolerance.** Again, due to poor dimensional accuracy, the model needs to have larger cavities and greater pressure angles on spline teeth, which has been reflected in later iterations of this design.

## Quick start

This project assumes you have have the following tools installed in order to modify and export a usable model:

* [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-free)
* [SketchUp STL plugin](https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/sketchup-stl)

## Changelog

## [0.3.0]
### Changed
- Minor adjustments to spline for better fit
- Reduce amount surfaces for handle bolt/shaft

## [0.2.0]
### Changed
- Diameter of spine assembly for higher printing tolerance
- Length of spline assembly to account for inconsistent spline cavity of handles
- Diameter of D-broach for higher printing tolerance
- Length of D-broach shaft to account for protrusion of entire assembly on initial plastic prototype

## [0.1.0]
### Added
- Initial design with low-tolerances for plastic prototypes
